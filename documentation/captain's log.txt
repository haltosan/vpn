can generate custom payloads on udp using packets.tcl

need more precision on hexinject filters
need to get packets sent and read correctly


3/6/19 - 4/9/19:
this was working on the bash scripts of crafting and capturing
this was mostly done on just the client and done in small "batches"
this created french work, extra french work, and extra (and as a result most of done)

got secure data transfer
need to expand to sending packets
